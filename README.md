# CyberSecurity-Projects-and-Labs

This repository showcases my hands-on cybersecurity projects, including defensive security (Blue Team), offensive security (Red Team), cloud security configurations, and malware analysis.

Each folder includes structured labs, attack simulations, tool usage, and documented findings — all aimed at building real-world skills for SOC, pentesting, and threat analysis roles.

---

## 🔹 Blue Team Labs
- **SIEM Alerting**: Created alerts in Splunk to detect brute-force and lateral movement attacks.
- **Windows IR**: Used Sysmon logs to investigate suspicious registry and process activity.

## 🔸 Red Team Labs
- **Hack The Box Machines**: Walkthroughs of vulnerable machines with full exploitation steps.
- **DVWA Labs**: Exploited XSS, SQL injection, and insecure session handling.

## ☁️ Cloud Security
- **IAM Misconfiguration Simulation**: Identified privilege escalation paths in AWS lab setup.
- **CloudTrail Log Analysis**: Detected abnormal behavior and documented findings.

## 🧬 Malware Analysis
- **Static & Dynamic Analysis**: Dissected ransomware samples in a sandbox using tools like Ghidra and Wireshark.
- **YARA Rule Writing**: Custom rules written for malware families based on behavior and strings.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
Splunk • Wireshark • Burp Suite • Nmap • Python • Bash • YARA • AWS IAM • Sysmon • ELK • TryHackMe • Hack The Box
